## Why Coollabs?

It's frustrating how deeply we are bonded to large companies. We use their products everyday. Rarely thinking of what we give them in return.

We allow them to collect & aggregate our personal information & do whatever they want with it!

They are selling literally to anybody who pays for it.
(+80% of Google's & +98% of Facebook's income is from targeted ads!)

Even if you keep yourself far away from their products, they are still able to collect data of you & your online behavior on any site where their services are integrated!
(+50% of all websites available online are using Google Analytics)

You & your user's should NOT be the products!
